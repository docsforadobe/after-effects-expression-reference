- [Vector Math](./vector-math.md) provides a suite of methods for working with vectors and arrays.
- [Random Numbers](./random-numbers.md) is for generating randomness within your expression.
- [Interpolation](./interpolation.md) is for converting values from one set to another, or using one set of values to drive another set of values.
- [Color Conversion](./color-conversion.md) is for changing between colour modes (such as converting RGB values to HSL, or Hex values to RGB)
