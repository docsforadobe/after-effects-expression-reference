Dan Ebberts provides example expressions and tutorials for learning how to work with expressions on his [MotionScript website](https://www.motionscript.com). For example, Dan provides an excellent [page about collision detection](http://www.motionscript.com/design-guide/collision.html).

The AE Enhancers forum provides many examples and much useful information about expressions, as well as scripts and animation presets. In [this post on the AE Enhancers forum](https://aenhancers.com/viewtopic.php?t=630), Paul Tuersley provides a tutorial and example project that show how to use expressions to animate several layers in a swarm.

Rick Gerard provides an example on [Rick's site](https://hottek.net/2007/11/square-wheels.html) that demonstrates rolling a square object along a floor so that the sides stay in contact with the floor plane.

Chris Zwar provides an example project on [chriszwar.com](http://chriszwar.com/wordpress/2008/11/imagegrids/) for automatically arranging still images or videos into a grid (like a video wall). You can easily adjust position and spacing with sliders that are connected to a system of expressions. There are three compositions in the projectâ€”one for stills, one for videos, and one to create an auto-storyboard in which a video is sampled at user-defined intervals and aligned into a grid.

[JJ Gifford's website](http://www.jjgifford.com/expressions/) provides several example projects that demonstrate how to use expressions.
