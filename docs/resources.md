Dan Ebberts provides example expressions and tutorials for learning how to work with expressions on his [MotionScript website](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_ae_motionscripthome). For example, Dan provides an excellent [page about collision detection](http://www.motionscript.com/design-guide/collision.html).

Colin Braley provides a tutorial and example project on [their site](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_ae_colinrepelexpression) that show how to use expressions to make one layer repel others in a natural-seeming manner.

The AE Enhancers forum provides many examples and much useful information about expressions, as well as scripts and animation presets. In [this post on the AE Enhancers forum](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_ae_paulswarmexpression), Paul Tuersley provides a tutorial and example project that show how to use expressions to animate several layers in a swarm.

Carl Larsen provides a video tutorial on the [Creative COW website](http://library.creativecow.net/articles/larsen_carl/vehicle_rig.php) that demonstrates how to use expressions and parenting to relate the rotation of a set of wheels to the horizontal movement of a vehicle.

Chris Zwar provides an example project on [chriszwar.com](http://chriszwar.com/wordpress/2008/11/imagegrids/) for automatically arranging still images or videos into a grid (like a video wall). You can easily adjust position and spacing with sliders that are connected to a system of expressions. There are three compositions in the project—one for stills, one for videos, and one to create an auto-storyboard in which a video is sampled at user-defined intervals and aligned into a grid.

[JJ Gifford’s website](http://www.adobe.com/go/learn_ae_jjgiffordexpressions) provides several example projects that demonstrate how to use expressions.
